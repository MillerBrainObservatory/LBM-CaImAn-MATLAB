# API

There are two forms of functions to know for this pipeline:

1. {ref}`Core <core_api>` functions used to run the pipeline
2. {ref}`Utility <utility_api>` functions for interacting with pipeline outputs.
3. {ref}`Internals <internal_api>` functions intended for the pipeline, not public use and thus not listed here.

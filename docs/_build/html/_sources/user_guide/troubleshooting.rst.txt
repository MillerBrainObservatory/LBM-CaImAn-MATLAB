Troubleshooting
===============================

Missing Compiled Binary (Windows)
---------------------------------

**Problem:** The `run_CNMF_patches` function errors out on Windows.

**Cause:** Missing compiled binary for `graph_conn_comp_mex.mexw64`.

**Solution:**
1. Compile the binary in MATLAB via the command window:

   ```matlab
   >> mex .\CaImAn_Utilities\CaImAn-MATLAB-master\CaImAn-MATLAB-master\utilities\graph_conn_comp_mex.cpp
   Building with 'MinGW64 Compiler (C++)'.
   MEX completed successfully.
   ```

Less-Likely Issues
------------------

**Problem:** The `run_CNMF_patches` function still fails after addressing the common issues.

**Solution:**
1. Task Manager:
- End all MATLAB-related tasks.
2. Check MATLAB License:
- Run `license checkout Distrib_Computing_Toolbox`.
- If `Ans=1`, the license is valid.
3. Revert Local Profile:
- Create a new profile in the cluster manager, set it as default, and delete 'Processes'.
4. Replace Local Cluster Storage:
- Find `prefdir` using `>> prefdir` (e.g., `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB\R202x`).
- Delete the `MATLAB\local_cluster_jobs` directory one level up.
5. Check for Potentially Conflicting Files:
- Run `which -all startup.m`. If not found, it's not the issue.
- Run `which -all pathdef.m`. Ensure it's located in `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2023b\toolbox\local\pathdef.m`.
- Run `which -all matlabrc.m`. Ensure it's located in `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2023b\toolbox\local\matlabrc.m`.

If these solutions do not resolve the issue, please reach out for further assistance or schedule a Zoom call for additional troubleshooting.

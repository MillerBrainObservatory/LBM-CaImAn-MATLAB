ScanImage Metadata
##################

As discussed in :ref:`pre-processing`, reconstructing an image from the ScanImage `.tiff` file is handled internally by the pipeline.
This describes the metadata that hold all of the values used for that process.

The funcion :func:`get_metadata` takes as input a path to any `ScanImage`_ tiff file and extracts all of the critical information used for calculations,
returning to you a set of `key-value pairs <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25955749/what-is-a-key-value-pair>`_ containing the metadata name and the value.

Image Size
************

ScanImage multi-ROI .tiff outputs are made up of individual sections called that ScanImage calls `ROIs`. These `ROIs` collectively form a
ScanImage `ScanField`. The ScanField is measured in optical degrees. We use the `objective_resolution`, that gives the ratio of distance (in microns) between pixel
poxitions after the stage movement and the distance (in optical degrees) of the same movement. This is a direct conversion factor for the field distance to physical microns.

This is essentially a scale factor, converting the size / location from units of degrees to microns.

`num_pixel_xy` are the number of pixels in each `ROI`. With there being 9 ROIs, we know our image is :math:`144x8=1296` pixels wide.

So that explains why is our `image_length` is so high compared to our `image_width`.

However, you'll notice :math:`1200x9=10800` is significanly less than our `image_height`.

This is because the scanner is actually moving to the next ROI, so we stop collecting data for that period of time.
`num_lines_between_scanfields` is calculated using this amount of time and is stripped during the horizontal concatenation.

Image Frames
***************

During aquisition, the user is prompted to split the recorded frames across multiple .tiff files.
It doesn't matter which .tiff file is used for this function, the metadata used applies to each file.

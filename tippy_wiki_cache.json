SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1:1 indicates more signal than noise.</p>", "Image_registration": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Registrator_Demo2.png/320px-Registrator_Demo2.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p><b>Image registration</b> is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system. Data may be multiple photographs, data from different sensors, times, depths, or viewpoints. It is used in computer vision, medical imaging, military automatic target recognition, and compiling and analyzing images and data from satellites. Registration is necessary in order to be able to compare or integrate the data obtained from these different measurements.</p>"}
